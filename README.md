# Aerodynamic-Analysis-of-the-NASA-ONERA-M6-Wing

This project was my first venture into using ANSYS, and its primary purpose was to learn and explore the software's capabilities. I focused on its Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) module to perform a detailed aerodynamic analysis.

This project is a detailed aerodynamic analysis of the NASA ONERA M6 wing using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The main goal was to validate the capabilities of ANSYS Fluent for aerospace engineering applications.

The analysis determined the relationships between the wing's lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and its angle of attack. The study found that the most aerodynamically efficient operating conditions occurred at an angle of attack of 3 degrees.

The methodology involved setting up the wing geometry and a virtual wind tunnel in ANSYS DesignModeler, creating a computational mesh, and then running simulations in ANSYS Fluent. The project successfully validated its results by comparing them to established data from NASA.
